              <p>
                Your manager has a profound impact on whether or not you're happy at work. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could learn more about a new potential manager before taking the job? Here’s the catch – even if upward feedback is actually collected, the results are rarely (if ever) revealed to the people it impacts most. It’s time to clear the fog and make feedback open, transparent, and accessible. Prospective hires and team members deserve to be equipped with a tool to help them work with inspirational leaders that help them grow.

                Companies that go the extra mile to cultivate a distinctive leadership culture and employee experience deserve to be recognized, celebrated, and rewarded. It's harder than ever to attract and retain the best talent. We want to empower companies and leaders with the ability to showcase their strengths and keep the virtuous talent cycle going strong.

                Manager to direct report is not the only scenario where professional developmental advice is valid. Feedback should be multi-directional – transcending levels and departments – and everyone should be equitably accountable for their performance. <br>
                You should be able to: Celebrate an SVP that’s 3 levels above you for her inspirational leadership during a cross-functional initiative. Offer constructive advice to your manager that doesn’t seem to realize his Sunday night emails are hurting team morale. Hear from the people closest to your work (your peers) about your distinctive strengths that might’ve otherwise gone unnoticed.

        <p>Your submitted reviews are not associated with your name and are highly secure. Blossom.team is a safe space where you can engage openly and honestly. <br><br>

          To preserve your anonymity even further, we also make sure that when you sign-up and leave a review, your account is not automatically registered as a searchable profile. We won’t display your profile on your company or department pages until there is enough activity that (even with some stalker-level investigating) people can’t trace your content to your identity. We also give you the option to invite friends to the platform anonymously, if preferred. <br><br>
          
          It’s important to use your real name, company, and department when signing up to be able to fully capture the benefits of our platform and keep a pulse on your (and your team’s) performance and perspectives. Your profile details enable us to share notifications when other members of the community interact with you (e.g., request to add you as a profile in your company, leave you a review, view your profile, etc.), and helps us make sure that reviews are based on real interaction experiences.
