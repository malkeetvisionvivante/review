                <h4>How to provide or withdraw consent</h4>
                <p>Users can provide or withdraw consent to the use of Cookies and other Identifiers by setting their
                    preferences within the cookie notice or by updating such preferences via the relevant
                    consent-preferences widget accordingly, if available.<br><br>

                    Additionally, Users can manage preferences regarding Identifiers directly from within their own
                    device settings and prevent – for example – the storing of third-party Identifiers. It is also
                    possible, via relevant browser or device features, to delete previously stored Identifiers,
                    including those used to remember the User’s initial consent. Users can, for example, find
                    information about how to manage Identifiers in the most commonly used browsers at the following
                    addresses: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari and Microsoft Internet Explorer.<br><br>

                    With regard to any Identifiers stored by third parties, Users can manage their preferences and
                    withdraw their consent by clicking the related opt-out link (where provided), by using the means
                    indicated in the third party's privacy policy, or by contacting the third party.<br><br>

                    Notwithstanding the above, Users are hereby informed that they may follow the instructions provided
                    by YourOnlineChoices (EU), the Network Advertising Initiative (US) and the Digital Advertising
                    Alliance (US), DAAC (Canada), DDAI (Japan) or other similar services. Such initiatives allow Users
                    to select their tracking preferences for most of the advertising tools. The Owner thus recommends
