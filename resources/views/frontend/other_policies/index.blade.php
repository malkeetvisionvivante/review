	            <p>Much like Denny’s, Trader Joe’s was also founded in the ‘50s and includes their history on an “Our Story” page. But unlike Denny’s, they choose to explain their method of bringing value to shoppers: trader joes Considering that the chain’s main draw is high quality food at low prices, it makes sense that customers might question how Trader Joe’s can afford to charge less than other brands. This short explanation answers that question, and it’s easy to see how it could be very effective at drawing new customers to their local store.</p><br>

	            <p>Airbnb After the first two examples, you may think that older, more well-known businesses have an advantage when creating introduction pages. But as Airbnb demonstrates, a long history isn’t necessary: airbnb Their stats are impressive by any standard, and the map of countries could spark potential customers to check out what’s available in the areas they want to visit. Plus, who wouldn’t want to patronize a company that has listings with over 600 castles? Basecamp products are designed to make working together easier, so it makes sense that their about page is focused on their team: basecamp Highlighting their diversity and various locations is a testimony to the effectiveness of the project management tools they make. If it’s possible for this successful company to work out of 26 different cities, they’re certainly doing something right.</p><br>

	            <p> Munchery Another company that chooses to focus on their team is Munchery. But instead of describing them as group, they highlight individual employees with fun photos: munchery Many companies have employee photos on their sites (, but very few rival the originality of Munchery’s. By allowing each person to pose with something that represents their hobbies or interests, they bring a dose of personality to the site. And considering that their entire ordering system is online, that could certainly help customers feel more at ease while making a purchase. Periscope Video-streaming app Periscope has only been around for “just over a year,” so it’s important that their “About Us” page explains why their app is useful to people who may have never even heard of it.</p>
